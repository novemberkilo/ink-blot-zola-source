  ### The Author

  I'm Navin. I usually live in Sydney, Australia.

  I help build software systems. I prefer the functional style of programming and am partial to
  working with a statically typed language, with property-based testing. I have written production software
  in Haskell, Clojure, Rust, Python, Ruby and Javascript. For the last few years I've worked mainly on teams
  with data scientists and programmers and prior to that, I mostly worked with Rails projects.

  I studied Computer Science when Z-80s and 6502s were the microprocessors
  of the day and the university lab splurged on a bunch of [NeXT
  workstations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mac_OS_X). My
  Operating Systems class involved group readings of the Unix kernel
  source. Some mathematicians on campus were nice to me once and 10 years
  later I found myself with a PhD in pure mathematics and a couple of
  publications to my name.

  I have been around the block a few times, and lived a few very
  different lives. These include:

  * Research mathematician and teacher
  * PKI, Identity and Trust afficionado
  * Information security architect and consultant
  * Manager at a consulting firm and at a bank

  If there's one thing that's been a constant, it's that I like to learn - really a lot.
